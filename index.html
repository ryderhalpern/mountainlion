<br><br>
Primary food sources:Deer, reindeer, moose, hog, racoon, squirrel, muskrat, porcupine, beaver, skunk, lynx, wolf, opossum, armadillo, birds, and fish
<br><br>
They range all over the Americas. They will settle almost anywhere with shelter and prey, including forests, deserts, and wetlands. They can be found in West, South, and central regions of Texas.
<br><br>
They are reletivly close to the top of the food chain, so they help keep the population of their prey under control. They also help with invasve species and disease transmition, while increasing soil fertiliy and overall biodiversity.
<br><br>
They hunt invasive species such as wild pigs and feral horses, and smaller animals such as coyotes, racoons, and other rodents.
<br><br>
Unlike other large cats they cannot roar. Instead they growl, shreik, hiss, and purr similar to house cats. Their powerful hind legs enable them to jump as far as 40-45 feet(12-13 meters) in distance and can jump as high as 15 feet. They can sprint up to 50 miles per hour, which is fourth fastest in cat species worldwide.
